      <p>My name is <strong>Adriana</strong>! Thanks for stopping by my brand new, hand made, personal website. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> This is my first time doing anything like this, and I am excited to dive deeper into the world of Software Engineering. I have joined Flatiron School in hopes of bettering my future, expanding my knowledge, and pushing my limits on what I am able to learn. In 2021, I was one of the many people effected by the pandemic, and was one of the many who got laid off. When would be a better time to jump head first into a career change than the world turning upside down?! I am excited to dive into this field, not only to expand the diversity, but to maybe one day change the very face of Tech.</p>
    <h3><em>ABOUT ME</em></h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Orlando, Florida (home of the Mouse!) I am 29 years old and I am the oldest of <strong>10</strong> siblings. In my free time, you can catch me: <ul> 
           <div id="link"> <li>at a local show, supporting small local bands (or listening to my <em>own</em> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0vs1ffwXR9Q982ed0IADnH?si=1bfb5e0ed2134b0c">playlists</a>) </li> </div>
            <li>watching the newest cheesy horror movie</li> 
            <li>going out of the way to see the latest art installment at the closest museum</li>
            <li>practicing the latest makeup trend</li>
            <li>playing video games, like <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4">Fallout 4</a> or first person shooters like <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Apex_Legends_Wiki">Apex Legends</a></li> 
            <li>or impuslively changing my hair</li></p></ul>
    <h3><em>GOALS IN TECH</em></h3>
        <p>Some might say I have lofty goals, but I love thinking ambitiously. One day, I'd love to be the face of something ground breaking in tech. I'd love to see myself working with things in Tech that will enhance our future, like an app that rivals the social footprint of Facebook or Twitter. Being as groundbreaking as Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, and be a household name as the <em>woman</em> that transformed the face of tech. It may seem impossible to some, but I love the idea of thinking <strong>BIG</strong>. I hope to one day use my skills that I learn as a developer to work with AI or create something new that could benefit the human race as a whole.</p>
